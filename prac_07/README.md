# CP1404 Practical Repository

## About

This repository contains all practical work for CP1404 - Programming, completed by Shane Mughkerhegl.  
Each folder (e.g. `prac_01`, `prac_07`) contains Python programs focused on specific topics such as functions, file I/O, classes, and data structures.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned

- **Keep functions short and focused**: Functions should do one job and do it well.
- **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive variable, function, and class names so your code explains itself.
- **Separation of concerns**: Use separate files/modules and functions to isolate logic and keep code maintainable.
